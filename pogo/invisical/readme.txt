 Installation
------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy the src/ directory and its contents to a 
   convenient, MATLAB-accessible location.

2. cd to the (new) invisical/ directory from within MATLAB.

3. Run the setpath.m script to update the MATLAB path.

Optionally, to avoid having to run setpath again in the future, 
the MATLAB savepath command can be used to save the updated path
information to the pathdef.m file (which is read on startup).
